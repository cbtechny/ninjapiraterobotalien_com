      <h2>Welcome to Ninja Pirate Robot Alien</h2>
      <p>
        Happy New Year! Today marks the official launch of Ninja Pirate Robot Alien and the beginning
        of an exciting journey into indie game development. This first devlog covers our mission,
        development philosophy, and introduces our flagship project: <strong>Sackjack Island</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Ninja Pirate Robot Alien was founded with a simple goal: create games that are as fun to
        develop as they are to play. We believe in transparent development, community engagement,
        and bold creative choices that push boundaries while staying true to our vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our games blend vibrant comic-book aesthetics with modern game design principles,
        resulting in experiences that are visually striking, mechanically sound, and
        narratively engaging.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We embrace bold aesthetics with vibrant colors and explosive visual effects. Our development
        process emphasizes modular design for flexible, expandable systems. We're committed to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bold Aesthetics:</strong> Comic-book inspired visuals with explosive effects</li>
        <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> Flexible, expandable game systems for rapid prototyping</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent Development:</strong> Sharing our process through regular devlogs</li>
        <li><strong>Player-First:</strong> Gameplay feel and player experience are paramount</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Introducing Sackjack Island</h2>
      <p>
        Sackjack Island is our flagship project—a vibrant blackjack-style tournament game where
        potatoes battle it out on a mysterious island. Face off against quirky opponents, collect
        jokers and special cards, and unlock new fighters as you climb toward first place.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fast-paced blackjack matches with powerups and strategic depth</li>
        <li>Unlockable potato characters with unique abilities</li>
        <li>Comic-book inspired art style with bold, vibrant visuals</li>
        <li>Quick play sessions designed for engaging gameplay</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <p>
        We're taking a transparent approach to development using Godot Engine. Our process emphasizes
        rapid prototyping, community feedback, and regular updates. Expect devlogs covering:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical deep dives into game systems and mechanics</li>
        <li>Art and design process breakdowns</li>
        <li>Challenges we face and how we solve them</li>
        <li>Playable demos and prototypes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Over the coming weeks, we'll be diving into gameplay mechanics, creating card systems,
        and building our first playable prototype. The next devlog will focus on world-building
        and the modular systems powering Sackjack Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for joining us on this journey. Follow along as we build something explosive!
