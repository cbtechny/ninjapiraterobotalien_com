      <h2>Welcome to NinjaPirate Studio</h2>
      <p>
        Happy New Year! Today marks the official launch of NinjaPirate Studio and the beginning 
        of an exciting journey into indie game development. This first devlog covers our mission, 
        development philosophy, and introduces our flagship project: <strong>Sackjack Island</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At NinjaPirate Studio, we're committed to creating games with explosive energy, vibrant 
        aesthetics, and modular design. We believe in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transparent Development:</strong> Sharing our process through regular devlogs</li>
        <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Building games alongside our audience</li>
        <li><strong>Bold Aesthetics:</strong> Comic-book inspired visuals with modern flair</li>
        <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> Flexible, expandable game systems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Introducing Sackjack Island</h2>
      <p>
        Sackjack Island is our first major project—a vibrant adventure game that blends exploration, 
        puzzle-solving, and dynamic gameplay. Set on a mysterious island filled with secrets, 
        players will uncover the story of the island's peculiar inhabitants and discover their 
        own role in its future.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Modular level design allowing for emergent gameplay</li>
        <li>Comic-book inspired art style with explosive visual effects</li>
        <li>Environmental storytelling and rich world-building</li>
        <li>Interactive demos powered by Godot Engine</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Development Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We're taking a transparent approach to development. Expect regular devlogs covering:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical deep dives into game systems</li>
        <li>Art and design process breakdowns</li>
        <li>Challenges we face and how we solve them</li>
        <li>Playable demos and prototypes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Over the coming weeks, we'll be diving into world-building, establishing the core 
        gameplay loop, and creating our first playable prototype. The next devlog will focus 
        on level design and the modular systems powering Sackjack Island.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks for joining us on this journey. Follow along as we build something explosive!
