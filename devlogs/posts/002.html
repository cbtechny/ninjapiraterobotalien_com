      <h2>World-Building Progress</h2>
      <p>
        This week, we've made significant progress on the world of Sackjack Island. Our focus 
        has been on creating a cohesive environment that tells a story through exploration and 
        environmental details.
      </p>

      <h2>Modular Level Design</h2>
      <p>
        One of our core design principles is modularity. We're building Sackjack Island using 
        a modular approach that allows us to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> Quickly test new areas and gameplay ideas</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Narrative:</strong> Adjust story beats based on player feedback</li>
        <li><strong>Scalable Content:</strong> Add new areas without breaking existing systems</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Load only what's needed for each zone</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Zone Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        The island is divided into distinct zones, each with its own visual identity, gameplay 
        challenges, and narrative elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beach Landing:</strong> The player's entry point featuring tutorial mechanics</li>
        <li><strong>Jungle Canopy:</strong> Dense exploration area with vertical navigation</li>
        <li><strong>Ancient Ruins:</strong> Puzzle-focused zone revealing the island's history</li>
        <li><strong>Crystal Caves:</strong> Underground network with environmental hazards</li>
        <li><strong>Summit Sanctuary:</strong> Final area and narrative climax</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Environmental Storytelling</h2>
      <p>
        We're committed to telling Sackjack Island's story through the environment itself. 
        Players will piece together the narrative by discovering:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scattered artifacts revealing the island's past</li>
        <li>Environmental clues hinting at recent events</li>
        <li>Interactive elements that respond to player actions</li>
        <li>Visual motifs that connect different areas</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Visual Identity</h2>
      <p>
        The art style continues to evolve, blending comic-book aesthetics with modern rendering 
        techniques. We're using:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bold, saturated color palettes for each zone</li>
        <li>Dynamic lighting with explosive highlights</li>
        <li>Stylized geometry with hand-painted textures</li>
        <li>Particle effects for visual impact and feedback</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technical Deep Dive: Modular Tile System</h2>
      <p>
        Our modular system is built on a tile-based architecture in Godot. Each tile is a 
        self-contained scene that can be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Snapped together on a grid for rapid level building</li>
        <li>Customized with parameters for variation</li>
        <li>Loaded dynamically to optimize performance</li>
        <li>Reused across different zones with visual variants</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Now that the foundation is in place, we're moving into gameplay prototyping. The next 
        devlog will cover:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Core movement mechanics and feel</li>
        <li>Interaction systems for puzzles and exploration</li>
        <li>Early gameplay footage from our first playable prototype</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thanks for following along! We're excited to share more as Sackjack Island comes to life.
