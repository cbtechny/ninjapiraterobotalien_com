      <h2>World-Building Progress</h2>
      <p>
        This week, we've made significant progress on the world of Sackjack Island. Our focus 
        has been on creating a cohesive blackjack tournament environment that combines fast-paced 
        card gameplay with the island's quirky potato inhabitants.
      </p>

      <h2>Tournament Structure</h2>
      <p>
        On Sackjack Island, potatoes don't bake… they battle. The island hosts the biggest 
        blackjack tournament in the spud world, and players compete against quirky opponents 
        to climb toward first place.
      </p>

      <h2>The Island's Zones</h2>
      <p>
        The island is divided into distinct zones, each hosting different tournament stages 
        and opponents:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beach Landing - Tournament Prep Area:</strong> Your entry point to the island with gentle waves and golden sand. Converse with characters, prepare for battles, and get a feel for the island's unique blackjack style.</li>
        <li><strong>Jungle Canopy:</strong> Dense vegetation with vertical exploration and opponents that are more intelligent than they appear.</li>
        <li><strong>Summit Sanctuary:</strong> The island's highest point where all paths lead. Face off against the toughest opponent here.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Gameplay Focus</h2>
      <p>
        We're building the game around fast-paced blackjack mechanics with strategic depth:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quick Matches:</strong> Games are designed to be fast and engaging, perfect for quick sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Special Cards:</strong> Collect jokers and powerups to add strategic variety</li>
        <li><strong>Character Unlocks:</strong> Win to unlock new potato fighters with unique abilities</li>
        <li><strong>Tournament Progression:</strong> Climb through zones to reach the final showdown</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Visual Identity</h2>
      <p>
        The art style embraces vibrant comic-book aesthetics with bold colors and dynamic effects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bold, saturated color palettes for visual impact</li>
        <li>Dynamic lighting with explosive highlights</li>
        <li>Stylized character designs with expressive animations</li>
        <li>Particle effects for card actions and victories</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technical Approach: Modular Design</h2>
      <p>
        Our modular system in Godot allows for rapid prototyping and flexible content creation. 
        This approach enables us to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quickly test new card mechanics and opponent behaviors</li>
        <li>Add new characters and abilities without breaking existing systems</li>
        <li>Optimize performance by loading zones dynamically</li>
        <li>Respond to community feedback with iterative updates</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Now that the island structure is in place, we're diving into core gameplay mechanics. 
        The next devlog will cover:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blackjack mechanics and card system implementation</li>
        <li>Character abilities and strategic gameplay</li>
        <li>Early gameplay footage from our first playable prototype</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thanks for following along! We're excited to share more as Sackjack Island comes to life.
